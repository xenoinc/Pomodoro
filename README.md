## Pomodoro Technique
Pomodoro (/Po-mo`-do-ro/)simply means, tomato in Italian.

The **Pomodoro Technique** is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 20 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are called **pomodoros**, the plural in English of the Italian word _pomodoro_, which means **tomato**. The method is based on the idea that frequent breaks can improve mental agility.

More information can be found at [PomodoroTechnique.com](http://pomodorotechnique.com/), or just read about it on Wikipedia.

## Six stages in the technique:

1. Decide on the task to be done
1. Set the pomodoro timer to n minutes (traditionally n = 25)
1. Work on the task until the timer rings. If a distraction pops into  your head, write it down, but immediately get back on task.
1. After the timer rings, put a checkmark on a piece of paper
1. If you have less than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go to step 1
1. Else (i.e. after four pomodoros) take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your check mark count to zero, then go to step 1
